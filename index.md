While learning and working with microcontrollers such as Arduino Uno might seem
easy, if not even boring, there is a lot of interesting and fundamental mechanics
behind the scene.

In this documentation I plan to bring to light some of the basics of electrical
engineering and explanation of presented projects.

while doing so, I will provide some photos and diagrams to present particular
project.
